# Scriptural-Sentiment-Text-Analyzer-Final
Religious scriptures significantly influence worldview formulation and cultural values but continue to pose language and sentiment quantification challenges. 
In this, we suggest a Python-based Scriptural Data Analyzer combining pandas and NLTK for statistical examination of word frequency as well as positivity and negativity in holy scriptures. Through quantification of sentiment for comparative understanding between texts, the analyzer bridges gaps for past measures and fulfills the potential for an in-depth exploration in the field of spirituality. Trained model-based analyzer has an interactive backend/frontend design and is tested for past tools as well as for the cumbersome process of manual measurement. Experiment outcomes establish the potential of the analyzer for effectiveness as well as for transparent measure.
